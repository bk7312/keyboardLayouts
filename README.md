# KeyboardLayouts

A place to store my keyboard layout config files. Currently using the colemak layout with an extend layer, mainly via the Keychron K3 Pro keyboard.

## Extend layer config/scripts

Original config/scripts based on [Dreymar's extend layer](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html).

- archive/extend.ahk - Autohotkey script for use in Windows (need to compile, can run without admin).
- archive/karabiner_extend.json - Karabiner config for use in macOS.
- archive/keychron_k3_pro.json - VIA config for Keychron K3 Pro keyboard.

Alternative version with vim-style arrow keys also available.

- archive/extend_vim.ahk - Autohotkey script for use in Windows (need to compile, can run without admin).
- archive/karabiner_extend_vim.json - Karabiner config for use in macOS.
- archive/keychron_k3_pro_vim.json - VIA config for Keychron K3 Pro keyboard.

Eventually switched from the original Dreymar version to the vim-style arrow keys version, and currently experimenting with a slightly modified layout.

- Currently using keychron_k3_pro_20250615.json (mostly stopped using the AHK and Karabiner version).
